My research focuses on satellite remote sensing, time-series analysis, and geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) to investigate forest disturbance, resilience, and ecosystem dynamics under environmental change.

I integrate multi-sensor satellite data fusion, dense time-series modeling, and explainable machine learning to extract reliable and interpretable signals from large-scale Earth observation datasets.

## Key Research Themes

### Multi-sensor Data Fusion
I developed the Time-series-based Image Fusion (TIF) algorithm to harmonize Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery into a dense, 10 m optical time series. This work has been published in *[Remote Sensing of Environment](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2025.115035)* and is being integrated into NASA’s Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) pipeline.

Building on this foundation, my ongoing and future work expands TIF to multi-modal data streams, including MODIS, PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and upcoming missions such as NISAR. These advances aim to enable sub-daily to daily, high-resolution Earth observations over heterogeneous and cloud-prone regions, supporting applications such as crop stress monitoring, flood detection, and wildfire dynamics.

### Forest Resilience and Disturbance Dynamics
I use satellite time-series analysis to quantify forest resilience and post-disturbance recovery following drought, insect outbreaks, and other climate-driven stressors. My work provides the first field-based validation of satellite-derived resilience indicators based on temporal autocorrelation, demonstrating that observation cadence fundamentally controls the ability to detect ecosystem recovery rates.

By linking satellite signals with field measurements, forest inventories, and ecosystem networks (e.g., FLUXNET), my research bridges ecosystem physiology and large-scale remote sensing, improving the ecological interpretability of widely used resilience metrics. This work contributes to more robust monitoring of global forest stability under accelerating environmental change.

### Explainable Machine Learning and GeoAI
I apply machine learning models together with explainability tools (e.g., SHAP and causal inference frameworks) to identify the drivers of forest disturbance, resilience change, and vegetation-related risk. Rather than focusing solely on prediction, my work emphasizes **interpretability**, enabling mechanistic insight into how climate, disturbance history, and landscape structure shape ecosystem responses.

These approaches support both scientific discovery and decision-making, allowing remote sensing models to inform management strategies rather than operate as black boxes.

### Vegetation Risk and Infrastructure Vulnerability
In collaboration with the StormWise program and the Eversource Energy Center, I develop machine learning models that integrate satellite, aerial, LiDAR, and infrastructure data to quantify vegetation-related power outage risk. These tools translate environmental monitoring into actionable insights for utility vegetation management and climate adaptation.

My future work extends this framework to urban and human-dominated landscapes by combining street-level imagery, satellite indicators (heat stress, fire risk, vegetation decline), and socioeconomic data to assess infrastructure vulnerability and support climate-resilient planning.
