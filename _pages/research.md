## Research Overview

My research focuses on satellite remote sensing, time-series analysis, and geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) to investigate forest disturbance, resilience, and ecosystem dynamics under environmental change.

I integrate multi-sensor satellite data fusion, dense time-series modeling, and explainable machine learning to extract reliable and interpretable signals from large-scale Earth observation datasets.

## Key Research Themes

### Multi-sensor Data Fusion
I developed the Time-series-based Image Fusion (TIF) algorithm to harmonize Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery into a dense, 10 m optical time series. This work has been published in *Remote Sensing of Environment* and is being integrated into NASA’s Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) pipeline.

### Forest Resilience and Disturbance
My work evaluates satellite-derived resilience indicators using field observations and time-series analysis, with a focus on understanding forest recovery following drought, insect outbreaks, and other disturbances.

### Explainable Machine Learning and GeoAI
I apply machine learning models together with explainability tools (e.g., SHAP) to identify drivers of forest disturbance, resilience change, and infrastructure vulnerability.

### Foundation Models for Environmental Monitoring
I explore the use of transformer-based foundation model embeddings (e.g., AlphaEarth) for large-scale forest carbon estimation and ecosystem characterization.
