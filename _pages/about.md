My name is <strong>Kexin Song</strong>. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment at the University of Connecticut (UConn), working with the <strong>Global Environmental Remote Sensing Laboratory (GERS Lab)</strong> led by Dr. Zhe Zhu. I will join the <strong>Yale School of the Environment</strong> as a Postdoctoral Associate in 2026.

My research focuses on applying <strong>satellite remote sensing, time-series analysis, and geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI)</strong> to monitor and model forest disturbance, resilience, and ecosystem dynamics under environmental change. I integrate <strong>multi-sensor data fusion</strong>, dense satellite time series, and <strong>explainable machine learning</strong> to extract reliable and interpretable signals from large-scale, heterogeneous Earth observation datasets. Additional details are available on the <strong>Research</strong> page.

Before joining UConn, I received my <strong>M.S. degree from the University of Miami</strong>, where I worked with Dr. Peter Minnett on evaluating passive microwave and reanalysis products for Arctic sea-ice concentration. I earned my <strong>B.S. degree from Ocean University of China</strong>, with formal training in marine technology and remote sensing.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, playing badminton, and reading books on data-driven approaches to understanding my favorite planet, Earth.
