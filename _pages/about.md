## About Me

My name is **Kexin Song**. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment at the University of Connecticut (UConn), working with the **Global Environmental Remote Sensing Laboratory (GERS Lab)** led by Dr. Zhe Zhu. I will join the **Yale School of the Environment** as a Postdoctoral Associate in 2026.

My research focuses on using **satellite remote sensing, time-series analysis, and geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI)** to monitor and model forest disturbance, resilience, and ecosystem dynamics under environmental change. I integrate **multi-sensor data fusion**, dense satellite time series, and **explainable machine learning** to extract reliable and interpretable signals from large-scale, heterogeneous Earth observation data. More details can be found on the **Research** page.

Before joining UConn, I received my **M.S. degree from the University of Miami**, where I worked with Dr. Peter Minnett on evaluating passive microwave and reanalysis products for Arctic sea-ice concentration. I earned my **B.S. degree from Ocean University of China**, with training in marine technology and remote sensing.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, outdoor activities, and exploring data-driven approaches to understanding Earth system dynamics.
