My research builds scalable, application-driven frameworks to monitor and model forest disturbance, resilience, and ecosystem dynamics under environmental change. By integrating multi-sensor satellite data, ecosystem ecology, and AI/ML, I convert large-scale Earth observation data into decision-support tools for land managers, utilities, and forest carbon stakeholders. Additional details are available on the

 on evaluating passive microwave and reanalysis products for Arctic sea-ice concentration. 
I earned my <strong>B.S. degree from Ocean University of China</strong>, with formal training in marine science and remote sensing.
