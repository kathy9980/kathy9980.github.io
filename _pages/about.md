I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment at the University of Connecticut, and an incoming Postdoctoral Associate at the Yale School of the Environment. My research lies at the intersection of satellite remote sensing, geospatial data science, and artificial intelligence, with a focus on understanding forest disturbance, resilience, and ecosystem change across local to global scales.

My work is supported by NASA, NSF, and the Eversource Energy Center, and integrates multi-sensor data fusion, dense satellite time-series analysis, and explainable machine learning to extract reliable and interpretable signals from large, heterogeneous Earth observation datasets.

## Research Overview

My research addresses a central challenge in environmental data science: how to generate high-resolution, temporally consistent, and physically meaningful information from irregular and multi-source satellite observations. I develop methodological advances and apply them to real-world problems in forest health, carbon dynamics, and infrastructure resilience.

Key research themes include:

- **Multi-sensor data fusion** for harmonizing Landsat and Sentinel-2 into dense, 10 m optical time series  
- **Remote-sensing–based resilience indicators**, including field-validated temporal autocorrelation metrics  
- **Explainable machine learning** for identifying drivers of forest disturbance and recovery  
- **Foundation model embeddings** for large-scale forest carbon and ecosystem mapping  

My Time-series-based Image Fusion (TIF) algorithm has been published in *Remote Sensing of Environment* and is being integrated into NASA’s Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) product pipeline.

## Publications & Ongoing Work

I have authored and co-authored peer-reviewed publications in *Remote Sensing of Environment*, *Nature Geoscience*, *Earth and Space Science*, and *Journal of Forestry*, with additional manuscripts currently under revision at *Nature Ecology & Evolution* and *Nature*. My ongoing work focuses on global forest resilience change, insect disturbance dynamics, and AI-based assessment of roadside tree risk to power grid reliability.

## Teaching & Mentorship

I have served as a teaching assistant and lab instructor for **Remote Sensing of Environment**, leading hands-on labs in satellite data analysis and ENVI-based workflows. My teaching philosophy emphasizes student motivation, conceptual clarity, and ethical use of AI as a learning tool. I am interested in teaching courses in remote sensing, GIS, and environmental data science, and in developing new courses on AI and big data applications in environmental science.

## Professional Goals

My long-term goal is to pursue an academic research career focused on advancing Earth observation science while training the next generation of environmental data scientists. I am particularly interested in interdisciplinary collaboration at the interface of remote sensing, ecology, and AI, with applications to sustainability and climate resilience.
