<p>
My name is <strong>Kexin Song</strong>. I am a Ph.D. in the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment at the University of Connecticut (UConn), working with the 
<strong>
  <a href="https://gerslab.cahnr.uconn.edu/" target="_blank" style="color:#1a73e8; text-decoration:none;">
    Global Environmental Remote Sensing Laboratory (GERS Lab)

</strong>
 led by 
<strong>
  <a href="https://nre.uconn.edu/zhe-zhu/" target="_blank" style="color:#1a73e8; text-decoration:none;">
    Dr. Zhe Zhu
  </a>
</strong>.
 I will join the <strong>Yale School of the Environment</strong> as a Postdoctoral Associate in January 2026, working with <strong>Dr. Luke C. Sanford</strong> in the 
<strong>
  <a href="https://sanford-lab.github.io/" target="_blank" style="color:#1a73e8; text-decoration:none;">
    SPIRES Lab
  </a>
</strong>.

<p>
My research focuses on applying <strong>satellite remote sensing, time-series analysis, and geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI)</strong> to monitor and model forest disturbance, resilience, and ecosystem dynamics under environmental change. I integrate <strong>multi-sensor data fusion</strong>, dense satellite time series, and <strong>explainable machine learning</strong> to extract reliable and interpretable signals from large-scale, heterogeneous Earth observation datasets. Additional details are available on the <strong>Research</strong> page.

<p>
Before joining UConn, I received my <strong>M.S. degree from the University of Miami</strong>, where I worked with 
<strong>

    Dr. Peter Minnett

</strong>
 on evaluating passive microwave and reanalysis products for Arctic sea-ice concentration. 
I earned my <strong>B.S. degree from Ocean University of China</strong>, with formal training in marine technology and remote sensing.

<p>
In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, playing badminton, and reading books on data-driven approaches to understanding my favorite planet, Earth.
