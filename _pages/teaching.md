I view teaching as an opportunity to equip students with the conceptual foundations, technical skills, and critical thinking abilities needed to address complex environmental challenges. My approach emphasizes student motivation, hands-on learning, and ethical use of artificial intelligence as a learning tool rather than a substitute for reasoning.

I connect course content to real-world applications, incorporate active learning strategies such as project-based labs and group discussions, and provide visual and interactive materials to support students from diverse backgrounds.

## Teaching Experience

### Teaching Assistant / Lab Instructor  
**Remote Sensing of Environment (NRE 3535)**  
University of Connecticut | Fall 2023

- Led weekly laboratory sessions on satellite data acquisition, visualization, and analysis using ENVI  
- Delivered guest lectures on multispectral remote sensing and satellite geometry  
- Organized group discussions and student presentations  
- Graded assignments and provided constructive feedback to support student learning  

### Research Mentorship

- Mentored undergraduate and graduate students on projects involving satellite time-series analysis, machine learning, and forest disturbance monitoring  

## Future Teaching Interests

I am interested in teaching courses in:
- Remote Sensing of the Environment  
- Geographic Information Systems (GIS)  
- Environmental Data Science and Geospatial AI  
- AI and Big Data Applications in Environmental Science  

I am also enthusiastic about developing new courses that integrate satellite remote sensing, machine learning, and reproducible research workflows using Python, GIS, and cloud-based platforms.
